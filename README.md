# About me

Hi! I’m a passionate and creative engineer with a strong foundation in front-end development, technology, and digital creativity.

I earned an **A in Technology Applications** and an **A- in Introduction to Computer Science** in high school, My tech journey began early — during middle school in Ghana, I consistently demonstrated **outstanding computer science skills** that set me apart in class.

Outside the classroom, I’ve earned **multiple certifications from freeCodeCamp**, built a personal GitHub portfolio, and actively create content through my YouTube channel. I’m especially excited about combining visual design and code to build meaningful, user-friendly interfaces.

Let’s build something beautiful together. 💻🌍✨
